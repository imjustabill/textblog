Responsive Design

	<p>My site finally looks not-terrible on mobile devices! This was my first foray into the responsive design world, and I used <a href="http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/responsive-design-in-3-steps">this stupidly easy tutorial</a> to get started. I've only used some online testing tools to see how this looks on the iPhone/iPad, so feel free to yell at me if this looks awful on your device.</p>
