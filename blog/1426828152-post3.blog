<p>Wow, it's been a while since I've put anything here. I've been working on a few projects, most notably I'm now an associate producer on <a href="http://insaturnsrings.com/">In Saturn's Rings</a>, where I've been leading a team that is processing hundreds of thousands of images from the <a href="http://sdss3.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>. </p>
