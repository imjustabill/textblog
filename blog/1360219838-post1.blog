First Blog Post!
1360219838
<p>I never blog anymore. Mostly because I end up switching site hosts all the time, for one reason or another. Reinstalling Wordpress is always a pain, especially on my current setup on <a href="http://nearlyfreespeech.net">NearlyFreeSpeech</a>. I looked at some other blog engines and messed around with <a href="http://flatpress.org/">Flatpress</a> for a while, but I could never get the theme right. I really like my super simple layout, and don't want to spend all day figuring out a big layout engine for my tiny little website. So what's a nerd to do? Write it myself, of course.</p> <p>My super stupid blog engine just needs an Apache directory with directory indexing turned on. Individual blog posts are written as .blog files in the format: <pre>Title<br>Timestamp<br>Post</pre></p><p>I grab the directory page and parse though all the .blog links, fetch each one, and dump them out here. Simple, effective, and dumb. But now I never have to worry about finding a host that supports whatever language my blog engine runs, migrate databases, or look at Wordpress's PHP again.</p>
